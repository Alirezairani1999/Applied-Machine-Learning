# Course Project Resources:
To bring together and apply the various topics covered in this course, you will work on a machine learning project. The goal of the project is to go through the complete knowledge discovery process to answer one or more questions you have about a topic of your own choosing. You will acquire the data, formulate a question (or questions) of interest, perform the data analysis, and communicate the results. Projects are programming assignments that cover the topic of this course. Any project is written by **[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org)**. The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. Furthermore, we can include **mathematical notation** within markdown cells of Jupyter Notebook using **LaTeX**.  

## َUploading and Presentation of Project 
### Uploading Project in GitHub
Students individually implement given assignments in recommended language. 
Each Student should create his/her own folder inside of this folder (using pull request) and place his/her files in this folder. The name of each folder starts with the name of data followed by underline and it ends with the familyname of 
the student (NameOfData_Familyname). The folder should comprise a Readme.md file containing the analysis of the result.

### Project Presentation in the Class
Each student will explain his/her project in a 10–15 minute presentation to the class. Presentations should clearly convey the project ideas, methods, and results, including the question(s) being addressed, the motivation of the analyses being employed, and relevant evaluations, contributions, and discussion questions.

## Datasets:
The following resources may be helpful for those still undecided about their course projects. 
* [DataHub](https://datahub.io/) has a lot of structured data in formats such as RDF and CSV. 
* [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
* [CrowdFlower Data for Everyone library](http://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone)
* [Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html)

## Coding:
Programming assignments will require the use of Python 3.7, as well as additional Python packages as follows. <br>
* [Python 3.7:](https://www.python.org/downloads/) An interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language.
* [NumPy:](http://www.numpy.org) A Python package for scientific computing.
* [Pandas:](https://pandas.pydata.org) A Python package for high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
* [Scikit-Learn:](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) A Python package for machine learning.
* [Matplotlib:](https://matplotlib.org) A Python package for 2D plotting.
* [SciPy:](https://www.scipy.org) A Python package for mathematics, science, and engineering.
* [IPython:](https://ipython.org) An architecture for interactive computing with Python.

Most of the relevant software is a part of the [SciPy stack](https://www.scipy.org), a collection of Python-based open source software for mathematics, science, and engineering (which includes Python, NumPy, the SciPy library, Matplotlib, pandas, IPython, and scikit-learn). The [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) Python Distribution is a free distribution for the SciPy stack that supports Linux, Mac, and Windows. With over 6 million users, the open source Anaconda Distribution is the fastest and easiest way to do Python and R data science and machine learning on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. It's the industry standard for developing, testing, and training on a single machine.<br>

Tutorial: <br>
* [NumPy Tutorial](http://scipy.github.io/old-wiki/pages/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial) <br>
You can learn Python via the following websites: <br>
* [SoloLearn](http://www.sololearn.com/) (A great website for getting started with coding. It offers easy to follow lessons, interspersed with quizzes to help you retain what you are learning).
* [Google Developer Python Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)  (highly recommended as a way to master python in just a few hours!) 

### Latex
The students can include mathematical notation within markdown cells using LaTeX in their **[Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org)**.<br>
