# Course Project Resources:
Projects are programming assignments that cover the topic of this course. Any project is written by  
**[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org)**. The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. Furthermore, we can include **mathematical notation** within markdown cells of Jupyter Notebook using **LaTeX**. 
Students individually implement given assignments in recommended language. 
Each Student should create his/her own folder inside of this folder (using pull request) containing his/her projects. 
The name of each folder starts with the name of data followed by underline and it ends with the familyname of 
the student (NameOfData_Familyname). The folder should contain a Readme.md file in which any student should 
explain the result of his/her  analysis.  

## Datasets:
The following resources may be helpful for those still undecided about their course projects. 
* [DataHub](https://datahub.io/) has a lot of structured data in formats such as RDF and CSV. 
* [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
* [CrowdFlower Data for Everyone library](http://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone)
* [Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html)

To know more datasets, refer to the following webpage of [KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/index.html):
* [Datasets for Data Mining and Data Science](https://www.kdnuggets.com/datasets/index.html)

## Coding:
Programming assignments will require the use of Python 3.7, as well as additional Python packages as follows. <br>
* [Python 3.7:](https://www.python.org/downloads/) An interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language.
* [NumPy:](http://www.numpy.org) A Python package for scientific computing.
* [Pandas:](https://pandas.pydata.org) A Python package for high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
* [Scikit-Learn:](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) A Python package for machine learning.
* [Matplotlib:](https://matplotlib.org) A Python package for 2D plotting.
* [SciPy:](https://www.scipy.org) A Python package for mathematics, science, and engineering.
* [IPython:](https://ipython.org) An architecture for interactive computing with Python.

Most of the relevant software is a part of the [SciPy stack](https://www.scipy.org), a collection of Python-based open source software for mathematics, science, and engineering (which includes Python, NumPy, the SciPy library, Matplotlib, pandas, IPython, and scikit-learn). The [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) Python Distribution is a free distribution for the SciPy stack that supports Linux, Mac, and Windows. With over 6 million users, the open source Anaconda Distribution is the fastest and easiest way to do Python and R data science and machine learning on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. It's the industry standard for developing, testing, and training on a single machine.

Tutorial: <br>
* [NumPy Tutorial](http://scipy.github.io/old-wiki/pages/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial) <br>
You can learn Python via the following websites: <br>
* [SoloLearn](http://www.sololearn.com/) (A great website for getting started with coding. It offers easy to follow lessons, interspersed with quizzes to help you retain what you are learning).
* [Google Developer Python Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)  (highly recommended as a way to master python in just a few hours!) 

### Latex
The students can include mathematical notation within markdown cells using LaTeX in their **[Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org)**.<br>
