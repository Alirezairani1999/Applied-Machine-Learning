## Course Overview:
Learning algorithms are ubiquitous, and are playing an ever increasing role in our daily lives. How are they different from any old algorithm? How can we reason about the ability of an algorithm to “learn from examples”, and classify data it has never seen? We will introduce the formal notions of learnability, generalization, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, etc. The goal is also to introduce the fundamental techniques and models that are central in today’s machine learning  applications. Because machine Learning can only be understood through practice, by using the algorithms, the course is accompanied with practicals during which students test a variety of machine learning algorithm with real world data.

## Class time and Location:
Saturday and Monday 08:00-09:30 AM (Spring 2019), Room 204/1. 

## Projects:
Projects are programming assignments that cover the topic of this course. Any project is written by  
**[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org)**. Projects will require the use of Python 3.7, as well as additional Python libraries as follows. <br>
* [Python 3.7:](https://www.python.org/downloads/) An interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language. <br>
* [NumPy:](http://www.numpy.org) A Python package for scientific computing. <br>
* [Pandas:](https://pandas.pydata.org) A Python package for high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. <br>
* [Scikit-Learn:](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) A Python package for machine learning. <br>
* [Matplotlib:](https://matplotlib.org) A Python package for 2D plotting. <br>
* [SciPy:](https://www.scipy.org) A Python package for mathematics, science, and engineering. <br>
* [IPython:](https://ipython.org) An architecture for interactive computing with Python. <br>

**Latex:**
The students can include mathematical notation within markdown cells using LaTeX in their **[Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org)**.<br>

## Grading:
* Projects and Midterm – 50%
* Endterm – 50%

## Prerequisites:
General mathematical sophistication; and a solid understanding of Algorithms, Linear Algebra, and Probability Theory, at the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate level, or equivalent.

[Learn Probability and Statistics through interactive visualizations:](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/index.html#firstPage) Seeing Theory was created by Daniel Kunin while an undergraduate at Brown University. The goal of this website is to make statistics more accessible through interactive visualizations (designed using Mike Bostock’s JavaScript library D3.js).

## Topics:
Have a look at some reports of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or Stanford students ([CS224N](http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/2015/), [CS224D](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports_2016.html)) to get some general inspiration.

## Account:
It is necessary to have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to share your projects. It offers plans for both private repositories and free accounts. Github is like the hammer in your toolbox, therefore, you need to have it!

## Academic Honor Code:
Honesty and integrity are vital elements of the academic works. All your submitted assignments must be entirely your own (or your own group's).

We will follow the standard of Department of Mathematical Sciences approach: 
* You can get help, but you MUST acknowledge the help on the work you hand in
* Failure to acknowledge your sources is a violation of the Honor Code
*  You can talk to others about the algorithm(s) to be used to solve a homework problem; as long as you then mention their name(s) on the work you submit
* You should not use code of others or be looking at code of others when you write your own: You can talk to people but have to write your own solution/code

## Questions?
I will be having office hours for this course on Monday (09:30 AM--12:00 AM). If this is not convenient, email me at hhaji@sbu.ac.ir or talk to me after class.
