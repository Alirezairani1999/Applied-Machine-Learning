**Please Note:** In the Labex exercises, each empty cell must be different (modified) from the sample one. Therefore, the completed notebook will have at least 200 outputs. Furthermore, please review the tutorial video for submitting the assignment set 2.

-> Deadline: Saturday, Esfand 10, 23:59 (Advantage ~ 5 Points) - Extended to Saturday, Esfand 17, 23:59

## Assignment Set 3

    - Exercises: 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3     
    
-> Deadline: Monday, Esfand 19, 23:59 (Announced at Esfand 12) 

## Assignment Set 4

* Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn: Perform a basic Machine Learning Task on the [Coronavirus/Covid-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) Data (infected and death cases in the World and Iran).
    - Visualize total infected and death cases in the World and Iran over time.
    - Perform regressions on the data based on Scikit-learn's Linear Models: Linear and Polynomial (with different degrees) as well as at least one more method.
    - Fit a Gaussian function (curve) to the data.
    - Visualize every model and predict the total infected and death cases in the future.
    - Split data into a train and a test set, then repeat steps 2 to 4 using train data.
    - Evaluate your model predictions by comparing them to the test data.
    - Visualize both approaches (full and train data) for every model.
    - **Finally**: Employ everything you know about machine learning to develop a model based on the data, capable of offering   optimal prediction on the total infected and death cases in the World and Iran as well as visualization over time. (Try to be creative!)
 
**Please Note:** You can only use [Daily Reports](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports) from January 22 up to March 18.

* Solutions of the exercises as well as mathematical notations could be written in [Latex](https://github.com/hhaji/Applied-Machine-Learning#latex) (Advantage ~ 10 Points), either in jupyter notebook or pdf. MS Office or any other software (Advantage ~ 5 Points) could also be used, otherwise images of your handwriting should be included, which is not recommended! Please acknowledge which one is used.

# Scores

* Please visit the [Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ygd1pvTxv3YbedejVGhXTZJ349-rLdRuPKt32WkhXCY/edit?usp=sharing) for the scores (Updated at Esfand 25)
* Each assignment set is scored from 100 points as well as extra rewards. Therefore, the total score of each set can be more than 100.
*  **Submission after the deadline will not be accepted!**
   - **Exceptionally, Assignment 1 to 6, could be submitted after their deadline up to Farvardin 26, but it is subjected to a penalty of 30 points.**
<!--* Submission after the deadline is subjected to a penalty, which is 20 points for submission within a week after the deadline and 30 points for more than a week. --> 
* Failure to comply with the [Academic Honor Code](https://github.com/hhaji/Applied-Machine-Learning#academic-honor-code) will result in the ZERO score in each set and may have additional consequences!
* The final score of recitation will be calculated based on the weighted average of assignments, from 100 points. Moreover, it could be more than 100 due to the added rewards! 
* Scores may be commented. Furthermore, students could also comment on their scores and request for re-evaluation in the form of email, which will be considered at the end of the course.
