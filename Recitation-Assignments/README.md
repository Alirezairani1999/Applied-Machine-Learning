* Install Python Packages (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib) and Jupyter Lab in your new Environment.    
* Create a GitHub Account.   
* Create a Repository for this Course in your GitHub.  
* Use Markdown to Prepare a Readme file for your Repository. 
* Modify (at least enter your name) and Run the [Sample Notebook](https://github.com/hhaji/Applied-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Recitation-Assignments/assignments-1_sample.ipynb) in your Environment, then Upload it in your Github Repository.

-> Deadline: Saturday, Bahman 26, 23:59 (Advantage ~ 5 Points) - Extended to Sunday Bahman 27, 12:59

## Assignment Set 2

*  Python and Scientific Libraries:

    - Practice Numpy in [LabEx](https://labex.io/courses/100-numpy-exercises) 
    - Practice Pandas in [LabEx](https://labex.io/courses/100-pandas-exercises)   
    - Practice Matplotlib in [LabEx](https://labex.io/courses/draw-2d-and-3d-graphics-by-matplotlib) 
    - Then Push/Upload each of the three jupyter notebooks using git in the Labex machine. (Try to be creative!)

**Please Note:** In the Labex exercises, each empty cell must be different (modified) from the sample one. Therefore, the completed notebook will have at least 200 outputs. Furthermore, please review the tutorial video for submitting the assignment set 2.

-> Deadline: Saturday, Esfand 10, 23:59 (Advantage ~ 5 Points) - Extended to Saturday, Esfand 17, 23:59

## Assignment Set 3

* Chapter 2 of [Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning)  

    - Exercises: 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 
     
**Please Note:** Solutions of the exercises can be written in [Latex](https://github.com/hhaji/Applied-Machine-Learning#latex) (Advantage ~ 10 Points), therefore you could add a notebook or pdf in your repository. MS Office or other softwares could also be used (Advantage ~ 5 Points), otherwise images of your handwriting should be included in the pdf or notebook, which is not recommended!    
    
-> Deadline: Monday, Esfand 19, 23:59 (Announced at Esfand 12) 

## Assignment Set 4

* Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn: Perform a basic Machine Learning Task on the [Coronavirus/Covid-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) Data (infected and death cases in the World and Iran).
    - Visualize total infected and death cases in the World and Iran over time. (Use only [Daily Reports](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports)) 
    - Perform regressions on the data based on Scikit-learn's Linear Models: Linear and Polynomial (with different degrees) as well as at least one more method.
    - Fit a gaussian function to the data.
    - Visualize every model and predict the total infected and death cases in the future.
    - Split data into a train and a test set, then repeat steps 2 to 4 using train data.
    - Evaluate your model predictions by comparing them to the test data.
    - Visualize both approaches (full and train data) for every model.
    - **Finally**: Employ everything you know about machine learning to develop a model based on the data, capable of offering   optimal prediction on the total infected and death cases in the World and Iran as well as visualization over time. (Try to be creative!)
 
 <!--* Part Two: Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn: Will be Announced!-->

-> Deadline: Wednesday, Esfand 28, 23:59 (Announced at Esfand 14) - **Won't be Extended!**

# Submission Instruction 

* Please register through the link: [Registration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n4WDjIZMKNghwnWzMhJKfUPSfHzUeyb4eholMpyMILY/edit?usp=sharing)
* Create a repository inside your github account with the exact name "Applied_Machine_Learning_S20_Assignments". (Rename it if already created.)
* Please review [Projects](https://github.com/hhaji/Applied-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Projects) for further instructions.
* After completing all tasks of every assignment set add related jupyter notebooks (and/or other files) in a folder in the repository, for instance, assignments-1.ipynb inside Assingment_Set_1 folder, for the first set.
* Solutions of the exercises as well as mathematical notations could be written in [Latex](https://github.com/hhaji/Applied-Machine-Learning#latex)(Advantage ~ 5 Points), either in jupyter notebook or pdf. MS Office or any other software (Advantage ~ 5 Points) could also be used, otherwise images of your handwriting should be included, which is not recommended! Please acknowledge which one is used.

# Scores

* Please visit the [Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ygd1pvTxv3YbedejVGhXTZJ349-rLdRuPKt32WkhXCY/edit?usp=sharing) for the scores.
* Each assignment set is scored from 100 points as well as extra rewards. Therefore, the total score of each set can be more than 100.
* Submission after the deadline is subjected to a penalty, which is 20 points for submission within a week after the deadline and 30 points for more than a week. 
* Failure to comply with the [Academic Honor Code](https://github.com/hhaji/Applied-Machine-Learning#academic-honor-code) will result in the ZERO score in each set and may have additional consequences!
