# Assignments 

## Assignment Set 1  

* Install Anaconda and Create an Environment.    
* Install Python Packages (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib) and Jupyter Lab in your new Environment.    
* Create a GitHub Account.   
* Create a Repository for this Course in your GitHub.  
* Use Markdown to Prepare a Readme file for your Repository. 
* Modify (at least enter your name) and Run the [Sample Notebook](https://github.com/hhaji/Applied-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Recitation-Assignments/assignments-1_sample.ipynb) in your Environment, then Upload it in your Github Repository.

-> Deadline: Saturday, Bahman 26, 23:59 (Advantage ~ 5 Points) - Extended to Sunday Bahman 27, 12:59

## Assignment Set 2

*  Python and Scientific Libraries:

    - Practice Numpy in [LabEx](https://labex.io/courses/100-numpy-exercises) 
    - Practice Pandas in [LabEx](https://labex.io/courses/100-pandas-exercises)   
    - Practice Matplotlib in [LabEx](https://labex.io/courses/draw-2d-and-3d-graphics-by-matplotlib) 
    - Then Push/Upload each of the three jupyter notebooks using git in the Labex machine. (Try to be creative!)

**Please Note:** In the Labex exercieses, each empty cell must be different (modified) from the sample one. Therfore, the completed notbook will have atleast 200 outputs. Furtheremore, please review the tutorial video for submiting the assignment set 2.

-> Deadline: Saturday, Esfand 10, 23:59 (Advantage ~ 5 Points) - Extended to Wednesday, Esfand 14, 23:59

## Assignment Set 3

* Chapter 2 of [Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning)  

    - Exercises: 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 
    
* Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn: Perform a basic Machine Learning Task on the [CoronaVirus/Covid-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) Data (infected and death cases in the World and Iran).
    - Visualize total infected and death cases in the World and Iran in the course of time (You can only use [daily reports](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports)) 
    - Perform regressions on the data based on Scikit-learn's Linear Models: Linear and Polynomial (with different degrees) as well as at least one more method.
    - Fit a gaussian function to the data.
    - Visualize evey model and predict the total infected and death cases in future.
    - Split data into a train and a test set, then repeat steps 2 to 4 by means of train data.
    - Evaluate your model predictions by comparing them to the test data.
    - Visulize both approaches for every model.
    - **Finally**: employ everything you know about machine learning to develop a model based on the data, capbale of offering   best prediction on the totall infected and death cases in the World and Iran as well as viualization over time. (Try to be creative!)
    
-> Deadline: Monday, Esfand 19, 23:59 - **Won't be Extended!** 

# Submission Instruction 

* Please register through the link: [Registration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n4WDjIZMKNghwnWzMhJKfUPSfHzUeyb4eholMpyMILY/edit?usp=sharing)
* Create a repository inside your github account with the exact name "Applied_Machine_Learning_S20_Assignments". (Rename it if already created.)
* Please review [Projects](https://github.com/hhaji/Applied-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Projects) for further instructions.

# Scores

* Please visit the [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ygd1pvTxv3YbedejVGhXTZJ349-rLdRuPKt32WkhXCY/edit?usp=sharing) for the scores.
* Each assignment set is scored from 100 points as well as extra rewards.Therfore, the total score of each set can be more than 100.
* Sumbmission after deadline is subjected to a penalty, which is 20 points for submission within a week after the deadline and 30 points for more than a week. 
* Failure to comply [Academic Honor Code](https://github.com/hhaji/Applied-Machine-Learning#academic-honor-code) will results in ZERO score in each set and may have additional consequences!
