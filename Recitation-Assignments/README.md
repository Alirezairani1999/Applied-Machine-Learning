<!--* Submission after the deadline is subjected to a penalty, which is 20 points for submission within a week after the deadline and 30 points for more than a week. --> 
* Failure to comply with the [Academic Honor Code](https://github.com/hhaji/Applied-Machine-Learning#academic-honor-code) will result in the ZERO score in each set and may have additional consequences!
* The final score of recitation will be calculated based on the weighted average of assignments, from 100 points. Moreover, it could be more than 100 due to the added rewards! 
* Scores may be commented. Furthermore, students could also comment on their scores and request for re-evaluation in the form of email, which will be considered at the end of the course.
