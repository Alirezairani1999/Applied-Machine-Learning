## <a name="Course-Overview"></a>Course Overview:
```javascript
Machine learning is an area of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to 
automatically learn. Machine learning allows machines to handle new situations via analysis, 
self-training, observation and experience. The wonderful success of machine learning has made 
it the default method of choice for artificial intelligence experts. In this course, we review 
the fundamentals and algorithms of machine learning.

### <a name="Probability-and-Statistics"></a>Probability and Statistics:
- [Learn Probability and Statistics Through Interactive Visualizations:](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/index.html#firstPage) Seeing Theory was created by Daniel Kunin while an undergraduate at Brown University. The goal of this website is to make statistics more accessible through interactive visualizations (designed using Mike Bostock’s JavaScript library D3.js).
- [Statistics and Probability:](https://stattrek.com) This website provides training and tools to help you solve statistics problems quickly, easily, and accurately - without having to ask anyone for help.
- Jupyter NoteBooks: [Introduction to Statistics](https://github.com/rouseguy/intro2stats) by Bargava
- Video: Professor John Tsitsiklis's [Video Lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2010/video-lectures/) on Applied Probability.
- Video: Professor Krishna Jagannathan's [Video Lectures](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/108106083/) on Probability Theory.

## <a name="Topics"></a>Topics:
Have a look at some reports of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or Stanford students ([CS224N](http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/2015/), [CS224D](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports_2016.html)) to get some general inspiration.

## <a name="Account"></a>Account:
It is necessary to have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to share your projects. It offers 
plans for both private repositories and free accounts. Github is like the hammer in your toolbox, 
therefore, you need to have it!

## <a name="Academic-Honor-Code"></a>Academic Honor Code:
Honesty and integrity are vital elements of the academic works. All your submitted assignments must be entirely your own (or your own group's).

We will follow the standard of Department of Mathematical Sciences approach: 
* You can get help, but you MUST acknowledge the help on the work you hand in
* Failure to acknowledge your sources is a violation of the Honor Code
*  You can talk to others about the algorithm(s) to be used to solve a homework problem; as long as you then mention their name(s) on the work you submit
* You should not use code of others or be looking at code of others when you write your own: You can talk to people but have to write your own solution/code

## <a name="Questions"></a>Questions?
I will be having office hours for this course on Monday (09:30 AM--12:00 AM). If this is not convenient, email me at hhaji@sbu.ac.ir or talk to me after class.
